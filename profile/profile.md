Since I'm always formatting my computer and I don't like to setup a user profile image every time I do it, I created this bash script to setup a random user image for me every time I want. 

I highly recommend you guys to use this script alongside with a cron job, so you can decide when the script runs.
You can take a look at cron in this website:
